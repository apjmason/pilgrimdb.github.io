The [Cammino di Sant'Antonio][0] was originally a short route linking Camposampiero with Padova. This is now called the **Ultimo Cammino**, and there is now also the **Lungo Cammino**, which links Venice with Padova and Padova with the [Cammino di Assisi][1] at Montepaolo. The Venice-Padova-Monselice section is largely the same as the [Via Romea Leona][2] and the Padova-Ferrara section is largely the same as the [Via Romea Stadensis][3].
