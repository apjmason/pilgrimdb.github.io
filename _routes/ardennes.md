A route through the Ardennes, also called the **Chemin des Pèlerins** or **Via Arduinna** is under development, from the [Via Mosana][0] at Liège to the [GR654][1] at Vitry-le-François. The short section through the Semois, from Suxy to the border near Orval, was opened in 2005; a brochure is available from [Semois Tourisme][2].  
For more info on the current status, see [Luc Selleslagh's website][3].
