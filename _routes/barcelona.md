There are 2 Amigos-supported routes from Barcelona to Montserrat, both starting from the Placa Sant Jaume in the old town. The [Amigos in L'Hospitalet][0] have marked one via L'Hospitalet de Llobregat and the historical route along the Llobregat valley (62km); see their website for a description and guide. And the [Barcelona Amics][1] have marked one which heads north to the GR6 near Sant Medir; it then follows this to Montserrat via Sant Cugat. There is a detailed guide to this on the [gronze.com site][2].  
The [GR6][3] itself starts from the hills to the north of the city centre at Horta. There is also the [GR96][4], which starts from Vallvidrera. Both these GRs are also known as **Camí Romeu**,  
See [page on Camino Catalán][5] for info on main Girona-Montserrat-Ebro route.
