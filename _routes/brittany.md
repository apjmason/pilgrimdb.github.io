routes through Brittany from Pointe-St-Mathieu, Locquirec (plus spur from Moguériec and St Pol de Léon), Abbaye de Beauport have been developed by the [Breton Amis de St Jacques][0]. These meet at Redon and continue via Nantes to Clisson, where the [Association Vendéenne][1] have developed a continuation, joining the [Tours route][2] at St Jean d'Angély (Vendée section 150km; continuation to St Jean 60km). A guide to the routes as far as Clisson _Chemins de Saint-Jacques en Bretagne_ has been published by [Rando Editions][3]. A guide to the Clisson-St Jean section is available and can be downloaded from the Association's [website][4].  
See also the routes from Mt-St-Michel via [Rennes][5] and [Angers][6].
