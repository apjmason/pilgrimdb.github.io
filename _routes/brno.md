A [network of routes in Moravia][0] is planned. One from Brno to the [Jakobsweg Weinviertel][1] at Mikulov is marked, and the website also lists other routes using existing long-distance paths: from Olomouc to the north, from Velehrad to the east, and a link via Trebic and Trebon to the [Prague-Krumlov route][2] at Krumlov. It is planned that the Olomouc route will be linked to the network of Polish routes, and the Velehrad route to Slovakia.
