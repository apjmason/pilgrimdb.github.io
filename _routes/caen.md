A guide is available from the Association Normande. A 1:30,000 map of the route in Sarthe is available from the tourist office in Le Mans, and there is an overview guide to the route in Indre-et-Loire on the website of the [Tours Amis][2]. The Le Mans-Tours section is waymarked in the other direction as a route to [Mont-St-Michel][3]; see Association Sarthoise site for more info.
