A route, also known as the **Camino del Azahar**, from Cartagena, where according to legend St James first landed, and Murcia, which joins the [Camino del Sureste][0] at Petrola near Albacete. See [Cartagena Amigos website][1] and [CaminoPedia][2] (this describes the route as joining the Camino del Sureste at Fuente-Alamo, but that now runs further north and no longer goes to Fuente-Alamo).  
The first part to Murcia and Molina de Segura is coincident with the [Caminos de la Cruz][3].  
From Jumilla, there is an alternative route via Yecla to the [Ruta de la Lana][4] at Almansa. See Caminos de la Cruz for mapping for Jumilla-Yecla section.
