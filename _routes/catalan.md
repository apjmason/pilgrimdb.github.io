A collective term for the Camino de Santiago in Catalonia, **Camí de Sant Jaume** in Catalan. It can refer to any of the numerous Catalan routes, from the Pyrenees or from the main ports like Barcelona and Tarragona, but is mainly used for the main road from the Roussillon via Montserrat to the Ebro valley. Historically, this was the Via Domitia/Via Augusta via the Pyrenean pass at Panissars (near the modern Pertús/Perthus pass) to the Barcelona area, then Montserrat, and west to the Ebro valley. The Catalan government has, however, now funded a [major upgrade][0], which uses a different route between Girona and Montserrat. See [Roussillon][1], [Camì Gironí de Sant Jaume][2], [Camí de Sant Jaume][3]. The [Tarragona branch][4] is also now open.  
Eventually, the Catalan government plan to include spurs for various other routes developed by the various Amics, such as from the [Col d'Ares][5], the [Cerdanya][6], and [Barcelona][7].
