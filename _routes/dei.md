The [Via degli Dei][0] or Via della Stale connects Bologna and Florence (guide published by Tamari Montagna), and is broadly based on the Roman road known as the Via Flaminia Minore or Via Flaminia Militare. The CAI marking starts from Casalecchio di Reno on the W outskirts of Bologna ([Itinerari Bologna][1] gives link from Meloncello), and ends at Fiesole on the N outskirts of Florence. There is also a spur to Prato, with its shrine of the Cintola della Vergine (Madonna's girdle).
