a route along the river Ebro from Tortosa via the important Jacobean shrine at Zaragoza to Logroño has been created; for details see [Mundicamino website][0]. Further details on the section in Navarra on [Rutas Navarra][1] and [Ribera Amigos site][2]; on the La Rioja section, on [Juan Carlos Miguel's site][3].  
This route along the Ebro is supposedly that used by St James when leaving Spain, commemorated by the town in the Ebro delta called Sant Jaume d'Enveja.
