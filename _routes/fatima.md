The [Centro Nacional de Cultura][0] is developing pilgrimage routes to **Fátima**, waymarked with blue arrows: one from Lisbon largely along the river Tejo is complete (there is an overview on the [tourist board site][1]), and one from Porto is under development. A guide to the Lisbon route, Caminho do Tejo/Caminho de Fátima, is published by Readers Digest and available from the CNC.  
The routes are coincident with the [Caminho Português][2] between Lisbon and Santarém and between Ansião and Porto; see that page for details on the latter section.
