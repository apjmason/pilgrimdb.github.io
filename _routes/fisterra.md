Some pilgrims carried on from Santiago to Land's End **Fisterra/Finisterre** and/or to Our Lady of the Ship at Muxía, both of which routes are now waymarked. A route between Fisterra and Muxía is also waymarked (30km). See the Galician Amigos' [website][0] or [Mundicamino][1] for a detailed description.
