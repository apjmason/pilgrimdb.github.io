Despite the fact that a 'road from France' in France is a nonsensical concept, the whole of Sigeric's route, including the section in France, was adopted by the [European Institute of Cultural Routes][0] as one of their 'pilgrim pathways'. There is however no agreement on the exact line of any modern walking route, although a GR, the GR145, roughly based on the route, is gradually being assembled by local FFRP groups, currently scheduled for completion in 2013\.  
The [Association Internationale Via Francigena][1] published the first maps with a suggested route, but this is no longer available. [Lightfoot][2] have however published a guide in English with their suggested route, based on the AIVF's. In Pas de Calais, the GAL in [Artois Lys][3] has marked a route, for which a [guide is available][4]; however, this does not correspond with the AIVF or Lightfoot routes. The GR145 in [Champagne-Ardenne][5] has also been completed; and see [Tourisme Langres][6] for route in Hte-Marne.  
There is also an [Association Via Francigena France][7], which unites various organisations with an interest in developing routes.
