As described on the main [Via Francigena page][0], three main branches of this are being developed:

* Gt St Bernard: for detailed mapping and a description of the route from the GSB to Rome, see [AEVF site][1]. This is the route marked under the auspices of the Italian Culture Ministry.  
For additional guides and maps, see [Association International Via Francigena][2], and there are now numerous commercial guides, including the [Lightfoot guide][3] in English. However, these do not necessarily follow the official route.  
The mapping shown below includes an alternative route into Rome that avoids the busy main road. This is an unofficial route based on that devised by Alberto Alberti of the [Gruppo Dodice][4]; an English translation appeared in issue 7 (August 2009) of the Newsletter of the [Confraternity of Pilgrims to Rome][5]
* Montgenèvre/Susa: the [Confraternita di San Jacopo di Compostella][6] has been very active in the development of the Via Francigena. They are particularly interested in the Montgenèvre and Menton routes, as they provide the link with Compostela. Consequently, their [guide][7], published by Terre di Mezzo, mainly deals with this route, though it does outline the other two. They also now produce maps of this route, and their website includes a [list of the stages with km][8]. There is also an outline guide to the route on the [Mundicamino site][9]
* Menton/coast road: this route, the [Via della Costa][10], is also now complete. A guide by Monica D'Atti and Franco Cinti, _La Via della Costa: 300 chilometri da Mentone a Sarzana_, is now published by [Ed Terre di Mezzo][11]. [Imperia province][12] produce a leaflet for their section from the border to Cervo
