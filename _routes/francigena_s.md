Historically, many pilgrims to Rome carried on to the Apulian ports to set sail for the Holy Land; some branched off at Troia to visit the shrine of St Michael at Monte Sant'Angelo. The roads of the time were still largely based on the Roman roads, principally the Via Latina and the Via Appia, together with its later southern variant, the Via Appia Traiana. See [map on Wikipedia][0].  
A long-term project under the generic name of [Via Francigena del Sud][1] is under way to develop this as a modern walking route, A guide to one route by Monica D'Atti and Franco Cinti, _La Via Francigena del Sud: Da Roma ai porti d'imbarco per la Terra Santa_, is now published by [Ed Terre di Mezzo][2].  
Waymarking activities have so far concentrated on routes from Rome to Monte Sant'Angelo, also variously known as the **Cammino dell'Arcangelo**, **Via Micaelica** and historically **Via Sacra Langobardorum**:

* the Rome-Benevento section is under development, and will consist of several branches; see [Cultura Lazio][3] for an overview map of the sections in Lazio
  * the most westerly branch is the [Via Francigena Appia Pedemontana][4], based on the Appia Antica
  * further east, a route via Montecassino based on the Via Prenestina and Via Latina is being developed; the 110km section between Ferentino and Gabii is now complete (see [Fondazione Percorsi Giubilari][5]). It is hoped to use a converted railway line to continue this on to the Porta Maggiore into Rome
  * the [GAL Titerno][6] has developed a network of routes around Benevento, including the section from Faicchio/Puglianello to Benevento
* the ca200km section, known as the [Cammino dell'Arcangelo][7], from Benevento to Monte Sant'Angelo, was officially opened in May 2009See also [Iubilantes route][8].
