There is now a [GR][0] based on the [Chemin de Régordane][1], which links Le Puy with St-Gilles. The original guidebook was by Marcel Girault, _Le chemin de Régordane: Guide à l'usage des pèlerins de Saint-Gilles_, and the GR700 is based on it. It was of course also used by pilgrims from the south to Le Puy. See also [www.regordane.info][2].  
See also [Association des Chemins de saint Gilles][3], who organise regular pilgrimages along pilgrimage routes to St-Gilles.
