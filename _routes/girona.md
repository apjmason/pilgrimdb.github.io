This route from the Panissars pass to Montserrat leaves the Via Augusta at Girona, and turns inland to Vic and then southwest to Montserrat; there are also spurs from the important 9th-century monastery of Sant Pere de Rodes, and from Olot. This route is being promoted by the Catalan government, and also by the [Amics in Girona][0], A guide is available from the [Catalan government site][1], and there is a guide to the route at [Mundicamino][2]. There is also a printed guide in French, published by [Rando Editions][3].  
The Catalan government were also promoting a Via Augusta path (Sender de la Via Augusta) through the region enabling walkers/cyclists to continue from Girona along the historical road to the Barcelona area, but this seems to have disappeared from their website.
