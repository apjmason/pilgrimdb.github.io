2 routes from Corunna and Ferrol join at Bruma. The Corunna route is <100km so does not qualify for a compostela; for this reason, the Ferrol route is the more used, even though historically Corunna was far more important, particularly for pilgrims from Britain.  
There's a detailed description of the Ferrol route on the Galician Amigos' [website][0] and on [Mundicamino][1], an overview of the Corunna route on [Corunna's website][2] and a description of the route through the Concello of Cambre on [their website][3]. Oroso Concello has a [description][4] of the whole route, including a [detailed map][5] of their section.
