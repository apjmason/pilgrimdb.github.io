In 2003, the pilgrimage group Iubilantes, from Como, [devised a route][0] for a pilgrimage from Rome to Monte Sant'Angelo, and later published a book on their journey and route, [_Verso il Monte dell'Angelo_][1]. This route is now also known as the **Via Micaelica**. Their website includes a [summary of the route][2]. It does not follow the Roman roads, but instead takes a more direct route over the Appennines from Montecassino.  
See also [Rinaldo Cucchi's blog][3] on his pilgrimage largely based on the Iubilantes route.
