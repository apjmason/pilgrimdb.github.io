The Confraternity of St James has created a route called the St James Way, linking the Jacobean shrine at Reading Abbey with the major S coast port of Southampton. Between Alresford and Winchester it uses the [St Swithun's Way][0].  
As ferries no longer sail from Southampton, a possibility for pilgrims wishing to continue their journey in France is to use the [Pilgrims Trail][1] from Winchester to Portsmouth.  
See also [route suggestion page][2].
