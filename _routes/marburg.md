A route connecting the [Ã–kumenischer Pilgerweg][0] at the Wartburg near Eisenach with the [Elisabeth shrine at Marburg][1] and on to Cologne via Siegen was opened in 2007, the 800th anniversary of the birth of St Elisabeth. This is waymarked both as a Jakobsweg in the direction of Cologne and as an Elisabethpfad in the direction of Marburg.  
For info on the 190km Wartburg-Marburg section, including the guide, see [Elisabethpfad site][2]; for the 170km Marburg-Cologne section, see [Landschaftsverband Rheinland website][3], whose [guide][4] is published by Bachem.
