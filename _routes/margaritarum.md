The [Via Margaritarum][0] connects places as symbols of the [pearls of life][1]. There are 2 routes, each with 11 places serving as pearls: the 'basic route' (164km) from Budapest to the Holy Well shrine at Mátraverebély south of Salgotarjan, and the 'long route' from there via Esztergom, Tata and Papa to the Austrian border near Sopron, and on to the [Via Sacra][2] at Heiligenkreuz which it follows to Mariazell.
