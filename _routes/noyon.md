This is waymarked as the GR655 from the [Via Gallia Belgica][0] at St Quentin via Noyon and Compiègne to Paris.  
Pending publication of a full FFRP topoguide, the [Picardy region of the FFRP][1] have produced an interim guide to their section to Viarmes. There is an overview of the route in the Ile de France on the [regional FFRP site][2].  
  
As the GR meanders considerably in places, the [Amis de Saint Jacques à Compiègne][3] publish a more direct line in two sections, St Quentin-Compiègne (70km) and Compiègne-Paris (93km), collectively dubbed the **Chemin Estelle**.
