A network of routes leading to the shrine of St Olav in Nidaros/Trondheim has been developed, the main one being that from Oslo. For further information, see [site][0] of Norwegian Confraternity of St James and [pilegrim.info][1].  
For routes in Sweden see [Pilgrim i Sverige][2], and see [pilgrimstid.nu][3] for information on further routes being developed from Hudiksvall and Gävle on the Swedish coast.
