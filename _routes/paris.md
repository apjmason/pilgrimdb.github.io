For the section of the GR655 from Paris (see [St Quentin route][0] for continuation from north), there is a choice of a western route via Chartres (GR655 ouest) or an eastern route via Orléans (GR655 est).  
As the GR meanders considerably, local groups of Amis de St Jacques suggest a more direct route:

* Etampes-Orleans-Blois, see [Loiret group][1]
* Chaumont-Tours, see [Tours group][2]
* Epernon-Châteaudun, see [Chartres group][3]There is an overview of the route in the Ile de France on the [regional FFRP site][4]. The GR route through Eure-et-Loir is shown on the [Carte et Guide touristique][5]. The [Amis de St Jacques in Tours][2] have a guide to the section from Château-Renault to Tours on their website.  
See also [Lepère Edns][6] guides for alternative suggested routes to both Paris-Orleans-Tours and Paris-Chartres-Tours.  
  
(Note that there is currently a gap in the mapping for the GR between St-Dyé and Blois (some 20km if it roughly follows the river), as I am not sure where the GR goes and it is not yet shown on IGN maps. If anyone can provide info, pls let me know. You can instead use the Amis route, 'e' in the list below.)
