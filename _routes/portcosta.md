The coastal route from Porto, the **Camino Portugués de la Costa**, also known as the **Caminho do Noroeste** or **Caminho do Atlântico**. For the Portuguese section, see [caminador.es][0]. See also [Camara Municipal][1] for brochure on the section through Vila do Conde; [Amigos in Viana do Castelo][2]; [Associação Jacobeia dos Caminhos de Esposende][3].  
There are spurs to and from the main Barcelos route at São Pedro de Rates, and also a link along the Minho to Valença.  
On the Galician side, a route is marked from A Guarda via the monastery at Oia to Vigo, joining the Central route at Redondela. This route is also known as the **Camino Monacal** and according to a local tradition was the pilgrimage route used by Thomas Becket. A guide is produced by the [Asociación Amigos de los Pazos][4], and see A Guarda concello.  
This route has been officially adopted by the Xunta, but to date no work has been done on it.
