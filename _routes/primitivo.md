Thought to be the first pilgrimage route to Santiago, from when Oviedo was the centre of Christian Spain. From Oviedo via Lugo to the [Camino Franc√©s][0] at Palas de Rei. There are full descriptions of the route on the [Astur-Leonesa Amigos][1] and [Mundicamino][2] sites. The Galician Amigos have a detailed description of the Galician section on [their website][3], though going to Melide. The IGN map includes an extension from the coast at Ribadesella, and the CSJ guide a 37km one from Villaviciosa (for the latter, see [Mundicamino][4], sections 19-21).
