A route connecting Porretta Terme via the Sambuca with Pistoia, part of the old road connecting Bologna and Pistoia via the Reno valley. There is an online guide on the [Le Limentre site][0]. The route is also described in a guidebook published by [L'Arcobaleno][1], which describes a route from Nonantola which it calls the Via Romea Nonantolana; this is not the same as Modena's [route of that name][2] but similar to the route followed by the [Via Romea Leona][3].
