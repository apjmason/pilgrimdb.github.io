In 1999, the mountaineering youth organisation, [Giovane Montagna][0], organised a pilgrimage to Rome based on the Via Francigena. Two groups started from Novalesa and Aquileia, meeting in Modena, from where they continued to the Via Francigena proper at Fucecchio. A guide to their walk, _Il Sentiero del Pellegrino - sulle orme della Via Francigena_, is available.  
As their objective was more mountain walking than following pilgrim roads, I only list one section which might be useful for linking other routes listed on this site.
