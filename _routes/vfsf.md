The Via Francigena di San Francesco is a joint development of Umbria and Lazio that connects Assisi and Rieti with Rome. Eventually it is planned to extend it further north to Ravenna and Venice. The Umbria section, which originally started in Perugia but has now been extended from the Tuscan border at Citerna, is now called the [**Via di Francesco**][0] (their [previous site][1] describes the previous route from Perugia). For Lazio, see [VFSF site][2]; free cartoguidas, _La Via di Roma - la Via Francigena di San Francesco_, for the sections Piediluco-Rieti and Rieti-Rome, have also now been published and are available online, or from [APT Rieti][3]. Most of the Piediluco-Rieti section is coincident with the Cammino di Francesco. For info on this and other routes related to St Francis, including the link from La Verna, see [other page][4].
